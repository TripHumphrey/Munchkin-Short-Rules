## Playing

### Starting the Game
- If you have any cards in your hand that are either race or class cards, play them immediately. 
- If you have any item cards and want to equip them, you can also do so now.
- Roll the dice. Decide whether the player with the lowest or highest number starts. 

### Kick Open the Door
 - Draw a card from the "door pile". 
 - If it's a monster - fight it, then your turn ends. 
 - If it's a curse - it hits you. Then read below.
 - Any other card - it's yours. Put it in your hand. Then read below.

### Look For Trouble or Loot the Room
If you did not fight a monster, choose one of these option:
#### Look For Trouble
Choose to play a monster you hav in your hand and fight it for levels and treasure. 
#### Loot the Room
Choose to loot the "room" you entered and draw another card from the door pile. Keep it in your hand. 

### Charity
When your turn ends, you must have no more than five cards in your hand. If you have more, choose:
 - Play cards until you're down to five (curses, items etc.)
 - Give cards to the lowest level player until you're down to five cards. If you're the lowest level player, discard cards until you're down to five.
