# Rules

## Setup

- Divide the cards into a treasure (brown) and a door (yellow/whit) stack.
- Give each player four of each card. Give each player a level token. Everyone should start at level 1. 

### Cards
- Item cards: Items have a price at the bottom om the card and "_+ somenumber_" at the top of the card. 
- Monster cards: Monster cards have a level and name at the top of the card and "_somenumber Treasures_" at the bottom. 
- Curse cards: Curse cards have "_Curse!_" at the top of the card.

## Playing

### Starting the Game
- If you have any cards in your hand that are either race or class cards, play them immediately, and gain their abilities.
- If you have any item cards and want to equip them, you can also do so now.
- Roll the dice. Decide whether the player with the lowest or highest number starts. 

### Kick Open the Door
 - Draw a card from the "door pile". 
 - If it's a monster - fight it, then your turn ends. 
 - If it's a curse - it hits you. Then read below.
 - Any other card - it's yours. Put it in your hand. Then read below.

### Look For Trouble or Loot the Room
If you did not fight a monster, choose one of these option:
#### Look For Trouble
Choose to play a monster you hav in your hand and fight it for levels and treasure. 
#### Loot the Room
Choose to loot the "room" you entered and draw another card from the door pile. Keep it in your hand. 

### Charity
When your turn ends, you must have no more than five cards in your hand. If you have more, choose:
 - Play cards until you're down to five (curses, items etc.)
 - Give cards to the lowest level player until you're down to five cards. If you're the lowest level player, discard cards until you're down to five.  

## Combat
 - If your level plus bonuses add up to more than the monster, you win. You only get a level from **killing** the monster.
 - If you and the monster are tied, or the monster has more, you lose. Roll the dice. If you get a 5 or more, you escape. If not, read the monster card and do what the "Bad Stuff" is. 

## Items
- Items are not equipped when turned sideways on the table. You can only equip when not in combat. 
- You can only carry one type of item (headgear, armor etc.)
- Selling items for 1000 Gold gets you a level.
- You can only carry one Big item.
- You may not trade items from your hand - only from the table. Traded items must go on the table, too.
